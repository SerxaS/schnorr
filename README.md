# Schnorr Signatures and MuSig over Arkworks

This project provides a modular and zk-friendly implementation of Schnorr signatures and MuSig multi-signatures over elliptic curve groups, using the [arkworks](https://github.com/arkworks-rs) ecosystem.

---

### ðŸ”§ Features

- **Poseidon-based sponge hashing** (native implementation)
- **Schnorr signatures** over any curve group (`G: CurveGroup`)
- **MuSig multi-party signatures**: Aggregates signatures from multiple participants
- **Transcript abstraction** for Fiatâ€“Shamir transformation
- Designed for **ZK circuits**, **recursive proofs**, and **modular backend swaps**

---

### Usage

This crate is under active development. Stay tuned for:

- Expanded unit tests
- Circuit-ready signature gadgets
- Seamless spongefish drop-in support

---

### Basic Example: Single Signature

To see **basic Schnorr signatures** and **MuSig multi-signatures** in action, you can run the following examples:

#### Basic Schnorr Signature Example

You can run a minimal example:

```bash
cargo run --example basic_sign
```

This will:

- Generate a key pair

- Sign a message

- Verify the signature using a Poseidon-based transcript

See examples/basic_sign.rs for full code.

---

### MuSig Example: Multi-party Aggregated Signature

To see MuSig multi-signature aggregation across multiple participants, run the following:

```bash
cargo run --example musig_sign
```

This will:

- Aggregate signatures from two participants

- Verify the aggregated MuSig signature using a Poseidon-based transcript

See examples/musig_sign.rs for full code.

ðŸ§  Schnorr Signatures over Arkworks with ZK Transcripts

This project provides a modular and zk-friendly implementation of Schnorr signatures over elliptic curve groups using the arkworks ecosystem.
ðŸ”§ Features

    âœ… Poseidon-based sponge hashing (native implementation)

    âœ… Curve-agnostic design using G: CurveGroup and F: PrimeField

    âœ… Transcript abstraction for Fiatâ€“Shamir transformation

    ðŸ”œ Planned integration with spongefish: a generic Fiatâ€“Shamir library for public-coin protocols

    ðŸš€ Designed for ZK circuits, recursive proofs, and modular backend swaps

ðŸ“¦ Usage

This crate is under active development. Stay tuned for:

    Expanded unit tests

    Circuit-ready signature gadgets

    Seamless spongefish drop-in support
